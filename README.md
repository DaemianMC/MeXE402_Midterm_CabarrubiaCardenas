## Linear Regression
### Introduction
Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a line (or hyperplane) that best predicts the dependent variable from the independents.
* ### Key Concepts
1. Dependent Variables (y)
   * This is the variable you want to predict or explain.
2. Independent Variables (X)
   * These are the variables that you believe influence the dependent variable.
3. Equation of the line
   * When there are multiple independent variables, the equation extends to:
     
     Y = b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub> X<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub> X<sub>2</sub> + ... + b<sub>n</sub> X<sub>n</sub> + Îµ
   * Here, each b coefficient represents the effect of each corresponding X variable on Y.

## Logistic Regression
* ### Introduction
   * Logistic regression models the probability of a binary outcome using one or more predictors. Unlike linear regression, it predicts probabilities to classify inputs into two classes, such as 0 or 1 (e.g., "yes" or "no").
