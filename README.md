## Linear Regression
### Introduction
Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a line (or hyperplane) that best predicts the dependent variable from the independents.
* ### Key Concepts
1. Dependent Variables (y)
   * This is the variable you want to predict or explain.
2. Independent Variables (X)
   * These are the variables that you believe influence the dependent variable.
3. Equation of the line
   * When there are multiple independent variables, the equation extends to:
     
     Y = b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub> X<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub> X<sub>2</sub> + ... + b<sub>n</sub> X<sub>n</sub> + Îµ
   * Here, each b coefficient represents the effect of each corresponding X variable on Y.

### Dataset Description
In the dataset [weather.csv](weather.csv), it contains information about weather data, including humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. It can be used to predict temperature patterns using linear regression.
* The dependent variable in this dataset is ***Temperature (C)***.
* The independent variables in this dataset are ***Apparent Temperature (C), Humidity, Wind Speed (km/h), Wind Bearings (degrees), Visibility (km)*** and ***Pressure (millibars)***

### Project Objectives
In doing this project, these are the things we want to achieve with our analysis:
* We aim to understand how the dataset can be used to predict temperature
* Through programming, we aim to develop a program that accurately predicts temperature using linear regression
* By means of evaluating the metrics through computing ***R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, Mean Squared Error and Root Mean Squared Error***.
* To better understand how to predict temperature using the dataset, we plan to provide visualizations such as a ***correlation heatmap, pairplot, and scatter plot***.

## Logistic Regression
* ### Introduction
   * Logistic regression models the probability of a binary outcome using one or more predictors. Unlike linear regression, it predicts probabilities to classify inputs into two classes, such as 0 or 1 (e.g., "yes" or "no").
